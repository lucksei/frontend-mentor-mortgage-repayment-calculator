## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

This was a very cool project with a lot of stylized elements that were also interactive, like inputs and checkboxes, which had me working overtime. I really underestimated this one, but it did allow me to practice Flexbox and Grid.

One major issue I faced was handling the checkboxes. Thankfully, I got it working with the help of this awesome guide on how to [style radio buttons by Stephanie Eckles](https://moderncss.dev/pure-css-custom-styled-radio-buttons/). Thank you so much!

Ignore the messy JS—though I considered refactoring the project, I’m more focused on learning than making it perfect, so I decided not to (just an excuse for my laziness...). As a result, the interactions might be somewhat buggy. Sorry about that.

Overall, this was a fun project to practice in my free time.

### Continued Development

Lots of refactoring is needed; the CSS styles are pretty messy. Also, vanilla JS leaves much to be desired...

### Useful resources

- [Pure CSS custom styled radio buttons](https://www.example.comhttps://moderncss.dev/pure-css-custom-styled-radio-buttons/) - This really helped me with making the animated checkboxes.
